-> In this paper, RCA framework called CloudRCA which makes use of multi-source data including KPI (key performance indicators), logs, topology and extracts important features via anomaly detection and log analysis techniques.
-> The features are utilized in a knowledge-informed Bayesian network (KHBN).

Proposed cloudRCA framework:
	-> Integration of three sources: Metrics, logs, module dependency relation in confuguration management database (CMDB).
	-> Data from multiple sources are converted into unified feature matrices through time series anomaly detection and log clustering algorithms.

Metrics anomaly detection: 
	-> Extraction of anomalous metrics collected from monitoring systems for the basis of RCA.
	-> Four typical anomalies: system breakdowns, change of mean, change of variance, change of long-term trend.
	-> Period length of time-series is identified. 
	-> First we have to decompose time series into tread, seasonality and remainder components. Traditional STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) proposed in suffers from less flexibility when seasonality period is long and is vulnerable to
noises. So, RobustSTL is used. It first extracts the trend component by solving a regression problem using the least absolute deviation loss with sparse regularization, then estimates the seasonality component with a non-local seasonal filtering.

Log templates Extraction and Clustering: 
	-> Sheer volume, varying syntax and semantics makes log analysis a non-trivial task.
	-> After standard preprocessing, templates are extracted by removing variables such as IP address, table name and interface IDs.
	-> Incrementally trainable algo. called Adaptive Frequent Template tree (AFT-tree) is developed to obtain log templates automatically instead of using regular expression.
	-> 



why clustering algo. in online mode?
